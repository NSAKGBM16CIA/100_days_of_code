# the idea of the code is to get input concatnate and comment
# I'm coding these projects as part of a 100-day challenge and I will code them both in python and Java


#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("So you are starting a band? Let us get you a name for it!\n")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input('Which city did you grow up in?\n')
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input('And, what is your pet\'s name?\n')
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print(f"Cool, You band name is: {city} {pet}")

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
